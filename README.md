# Idea Incubator: A Tool for Accelerated Research

## About This Project

This project began as a personal exploration—a way for me to practice building modern, agentic applications with AI at their core. Initially, it was a simple "idea generator." However, after a review with my CEO, Mr. Emmanuel, he saw the potential for something more impactful and encouraged me to develop it into a tool that could genuinely serve the research community.

This is the result of that evolution. The project is still under development, and I welcome anyone who is interested to contribute, share feedback, and help shape its future. My goal is to create something truly useful for innovators and researchers.

## Project Vision and Motivation

The initial idea for this project came from a simple observation: many brilliant researchers spend a great deal of time in the early phases of a project, trying to pinpoint a question that is both novel and impactful. It felt like there was an opportunity to use modern AI tools not just to solve problems, but to help us find the right problems to solve. What if we could build a tool that acted as a tireless brainstorming partner, one that had been exposed to a vast range of concepts and could help a researcher see connections they might have missed?

This led to the creation of the Idea Incubator. The vision was to build a platform that could streamline the journey from a vague notion to a structured research proposal. We wanted to make it easier for a researcher, especially someone new to a subfield of AI safety, to get their bearings and start exploring concrete, action-relevant questions. The goal was never to replace the researcher's intuition, but to augment it, providing a tool that could handle some of the heavy lifting of ideation and preliminary analysis, freeing up the researcher to focus on the core insights and experimental design as well.

## Application Features and Workflow

The application is designed around a clear, three-stage workflow that mirrors the early stages of  research project.

1.  **Novel Idea Generation**: The user starts by either entering a general problem area (like "making model reasoning more transparent") or a few keywords (like "mechanistic interpretability, sparse autoencoders"). The application’s AI then generates a set of novel research questions, each with a "novelty score" to indicate how original the concept is. The user can also explore predefined topics that are highly relevant to AI safety.

2.  **AI-Powered Refinement and Safety Analysis**: Once a promising question is selected, the user takes it to the analysis stage. Here, the AI refines the initial question into a more specific and testable hypothesis. It provides a deeper analysis, including suggesting potential experiments, identifying technical concepts, and offering a brief teaser on related work. Critically, a second AI agent then performs a **Safety & Ethics Analysis**, examining the refined idea for potential dual-use risks, new alignment challenges, and other ethical considerations. This encourages a safety-first mindset from the project's inception.

3.  **Development and Planning**: After an idea has been validated, the user can take it to the Build Studio. In this final stage, the user provides more detail on their project, and the AI generates a comprehensive, step-by-step development guide or experiment plan. This document serves as a detailed first draft, covering project setup, key development phases, and potential challenges, giving the researcher a solid foundation for their work.

## My Contribution

I served as the sole architect and engineer for this project, from the initial frontend design to the final deployment. My work involved defining the project's vision, designing the application's features and user workflow, and then partnering with an advanced AI development assistant to build and refine the full-stack application. My role was to ensure that all the components—the frontend interface, the backend AI flows, and the deployment infrastructure—came together to create a cohesive and impactful tool.

This project represents my ability to not only understand the technical landscape of AI but also to think strategically about how to apply these powerful tools to solve meaningful problems.
