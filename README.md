# AI Safety Idea Incubator

The **AI Safety Idea Incubator** is a web application designed to accelerate the AI safety research process. It uses generative AI to help researchers brainstorm novel research questions, refine them into testable hypotheses, and generate preliminary development guides.

This project was built to explore how modern AI tools can be leveraged to tackle the meta-problem of research itself, particularly within the fast-paced and critical field of AI safety.

## Relevance to LASR Labs

This project is directly relevant to the mission of LASR Labs as it demonstrates:

1.  **A Focus on Action-Relevant Research:** The application is explicitly tailored to the research areas LASR Labs focuses on, such as **Scalable Oversight**, **Interpretability**, **Deception in LLMs**, and **AI Control**. It's a tool designed to help generate and validate the very kind of projects LASR Labs undertakes.

2.  **Technical & Research Ability:** The project showcases the ability to architect and deliver a full-stack application (Next.js, React, Tailwind) that integrates a sophisticated AI backend (Google's Gemini via Genkit). It's a practical demonstration of using AI to build AI-related tools.

3.  **A Theory of Change for Impact:** The core idea is that by using AI to brainstorm and refine research directions, we can more quickly identify and pursue the most impactful AI safety work. This tool is a prototype for accelerating the "learn by doing" philosophy that LASR Labs champions.

## My Contribution

My role in this project was that of **Project Director and Architect**. I guided the entire development process from conception to execution, partnering with an advanced AI development assistant (Google's Gemini).

My key contributions included:

-   **Defining the Vision:** I conceived of the "Idea Incubator" and pivoted it into a tool specifically for AI safety researchers after analyzing the goals of organizations like LASR Labs.
-   **Architecting the Features:** I designed the user workflow, from initial research question generation to AI-powered refinement and analysis, including features like "Potential Impact Score" and "Viability Factors" charts.
-   **Directing the AI Partner:** I provided high-level directives, iterative feedback, and precise code-level instructions to the AI to build the application, debug issues, and refine the user experience.
-   **Ensuring Technical Cohesion:** I was responsible for making final decisions on the technical stack and ensuring all components (frontend, backend, AI flows) worked together seamlessly.

This project represents my ability to not only understand the technical landscape of AI but also to strategically leverage cutting-edge tools to build impactful, domain-specific applications.
