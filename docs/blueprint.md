# **App Name**: Idea Incubator

## Core Features:

- Novel Idea Generation: AI-powered tool to generate truly novel ideas by analyzing vast datasets and identifying white spaces in the market, avoiding frequently suggested ideas. User will input what kinds of problems they would like the model to focus on and some high-level topics or keywords, or leave that portion open-ended.
- Idea Dashboard: A personalized dashboard for users to save, categorize, and refine the generated ideas.
- Validation Score: Idea validation scoring, including market analysis data to rate market entry practicality.
- Visualization tools: Display of search results or charts relating to market viability and validation score.
- Community forum: Community forum for users to share, discuss, and provide feedback on generated ideas (moderated to ensure quality and relevance).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted lavender (#D0BCD5) conveys innovation without being overstimulating.
- Background color: A very light grey (#F5F5F5), near white, to promote focus on the ideas themselves.
- Accent color: A desaturated teal (#70A9A1), for interactive elements and key information callouts.
- Body text: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a modern, objective look. Headline text: 'Space Grotesk' to match 'Inter', for a techy feel.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons. These should focus on clarity and simplicity. Consider a feather as an app icon.
- A clean and intuitive interface with a focus on user experience and efficient idea exploration.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to maintain user engagement without being distracting.
